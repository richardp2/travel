It's my birthday today so we took the opportunity to go to Disneyland!!! Neither Rosie nor I have been to Disneyland before so it seemed like the right thing to do for my 25th birthday. We got up relatively early, checked the MTR maps and got going. We were at the park by 1030. At the entrance, there was mention that it was my birthday (Mark aiming for at least one cheaper ticket), we were told to head to the City Hall for a badge and stickers once inside. We did, then went for breakfast.

Every "cast member" we came across wished me happy birthday, and a number gave me more stickers. We had breakfast in a cafe that made Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes and waffles and I was presented with a free Birthday Sundae :). I won't go through our entire day, but it was awesome. We:
<ul>
	<li>explored Tarzan's tree house;</li>
	<li>went to a Mad Hatters tea party;</li>
	<li>saw a 3D Disney Show;</li>
	<li>visited Winnie the Pooh on a very Blustery Day;</li>
	<li>shot evil aliens with Buzz Lightyear;</li>
	<li>flew away with Dumbo;</li>
	<li>got pictures with Mickey and Minnie and much more.</li>
</ul>
After a brilliant day with the cast of Disney, we watched Disney in lights, a fireworks show above the fairytale castle. It was excellent. We will be visiting other Disney theme parks in the future, preferably the near future :D. Once we are back in the UK, we will get the photos from Rosie's camera and get them onto the gallery.
