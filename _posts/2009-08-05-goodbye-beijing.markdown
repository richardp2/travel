Took a relaxed approach to our last day in Beijing to recover from the Three Nations Expedition. Went to visit Peter Danford, who told us about a good restaurant, and a good place to get camera memory cards.

Walked through Ritan Park and had lunch where Peter recommended. Visited "Buy Now" electronics market and picked up some new memory cards.

Headed back to the hotel where we checked into our new rooms - Deluxe Suites :). Our tickets for the remainder of the trip had arrived, so we were relieved as we fly out early tomorrow morning.

This post will be expanded when we have time, just trying to get back up to date.
