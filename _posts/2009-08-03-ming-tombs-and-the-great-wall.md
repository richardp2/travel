Train arrived in Beijing at about 0715. Headed to KFC for breakfast then visited the Sacred Way and the Ming Tombs. Continued on to Jinshangling to the Great Wall.

Walked up to the wall to see the sunset before dinner. Not that impressive because it was so cloudy. After dinner, headed back up to the wall to sleep.

This post will be expanded when we have time, just trying to get back up to date.
