We have now set up a [Google Map](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=105040950430778297535.00046824cb0c8e86011f5&t=h&z=4) showing the extents of our trip, where we will be going, when we will be going, and how we will be travelling. We will endeavour to keep our current position updated, but due to the remoteness of our stay in Mongolia, this may not always be possible.
