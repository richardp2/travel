Today we had a half day tour at the Jokhang Monastery and Barkhor Street market. When we arrived at the Monastery, it was raining, but there were still numerous pilgrims outside prostrating for the end of suffering to all beings. There was no time limit on the tour of this Monastery, but it only houses about 110 monks so it isn't all that big. The Monastery had an thick air of Juniper smoke and many pilgrims were filling butter lamps and reciting mantras as they walked around.

From the roof of the Jokhang Monastery, there was an amazing view of the Potala Palace, only slightly dampened by the rain. Once we left the Monastery, we visited the Barkhor Street market, which lines the streets all the way around the Monastery. After our tour guide had taken us to the shops she was required to, we parted ways only to meet up with her again at lunch. The rest of the day has been another lazy day with neither of us feeling one hundred percent. Hopefully we will feel better tomorrow.
