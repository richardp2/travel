Well we are now married after a beautiful ceremony at the St Pierre Hotel in Chepstow. The day was glorious, sunshine, good food, great company, hopefully some fantastic photos, the works!! Having got that out of the way, we are now on to the important bit, the Honeymoon. We've decided on a week in Marrakech as part of an all inclusive package holiday. That should make it sufficiently unusual for it to be very memorable (the fact it is a package holiday is unusual in itself!!)

We left home far too early on the Monday morning following our wedding, arriving at Gatwick airport just before 7am. Although the flight was a little delayed, we actually landed early in Morocco before being whisked away, by coach, to our hotel. We had managed to consume 3 breakfasts between getting up and arriving in Marrakech so didn't feel like eating anything when we arrived. Instead we retired to our enormous suite for a nap!

The hotel (Riu Tikida Palmeraie) is brand new, having only opened on 21st November 2009. It is an absolutely beautiful place situated just outside the city itself with a free shuttle available throughout the day. The room we are staying in is a suite within a small, two storey accomodation block. The floor area of the suite is probably greater than that of our house!

We finished the day off with a drink by the pool, followed by dinner in the buffet restaurant. This included a huge variety of dishes from all over the world, so small portions were definately the way to go!
