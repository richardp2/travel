Apparently Thomson thought there was some kind volcanic ash over the UK so we ended up stuck at the Riu Tikida Palmeraie in Marrakech for an extra four days, all inclusive! It was such a tough time, but somebody had to suffer :-D. We were told on Sunday night that our flight the following day was definately cancelled so we chilled out!

The hotel, and Thomson reps all looked after the stranded Brits giving us information as and when it was available. They also let us know if there was a possibility of a flight each day meaning that we weren't stuck in the hotel! We, however, decided that we had managed to see everything we wanted to in Marrakech and so spent our time by the pool and in the bar reading and generally relaxing. It was great :-).

Turns out this package holiday malarchy is a really good idea when an Icelandic volcano takes the opportunity to erupt! Unlike most people, we had no problems getting back, no additional costs, and 4 extra days in the sun. We were extremely lucky. If we had gone ahead with our original plan of booking everything independantly we may have had a few more issues.

In conclusion, package holidays are a great idea! They're also good fun, although I think a real holiday should be the next one on the cards.
