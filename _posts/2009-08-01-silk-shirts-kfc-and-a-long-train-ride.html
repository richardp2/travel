Today was a rest day in anticipation of our night train to Xi'an. Checked out of the hotel and stowed baggage in left luggage room. Then headed out to the silk market to do a bit more shopping. Picked up some Chinese style silk shirts, and had the silk tailors make up some book covers out of off cuts for us.

Heavy rain greated us back at the hotel, so got a bit wet on the walk to the bus to the train station. We had soft sleepers for the journey to Xi'an which was due to last 11 hours.

This post will be expanded when we have time, just trying to get back up to date.
