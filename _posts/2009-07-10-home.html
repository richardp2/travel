Welcome to our Travel Blog. We set this site up as a diary of all our travelling exploits, starting with our trip to China in the summer of 2009. The blog was set up to keep everyone informed of where we were and what we were doing while we were in China for a short 2 month “sabbatical”. All our travel photos can be viewed along with all our other photos on our <a title="Rosie and Jim's Photo Gallery" href="http://photos.perry-online.me.uk/">Photo Site</a>.
<h3>Next trip: tbc</h3>
