In the Muslim world, Friday is the Sabbath day. That means that the bulk of the shops/markets, sites and sounds of Marrakech are closed. We therefore dedicated today to reading, relaxing and a little bit of swimming. We spent most of the day by the pool, but the latter part of the afternoon and evening was spent taking pictures around the hotel.
