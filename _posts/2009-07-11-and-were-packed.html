So we're finally packed, with just a few everyday essentials left out. We now only have two days left in work before heading out for two months of travelling. We're both getting very excited now, just a shame I haven't had time to get my head around Mandarin yet.

Hopefully the committe have sorted out the Visa's and don't forget to bring our passports to the airport :-) .
