Having arrived at Rachel's house last night, we got up this morning to a little last minute
packing/adjustments. After a trip to Asda with Diesel (Rach's new dog) and Richad, we headed
off to the airport, where Rachel got a little over excited at the intelligent parking system
in place at terminal 5.

When it came to us checking in, we found we were not going to be sitting with the rest of the
group because we (including Mark) had been upgraded to World Traveller Plus seats. After a
spot of lunch, it was off to the departure gates where we found we had again been upgraded,
now to Club World seats! So now we're sat here tucking into our potted crab and salad starter
with orange juice and champagne to wash it all down with. It's a tough life eh?
