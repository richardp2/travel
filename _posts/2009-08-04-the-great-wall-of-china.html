Woke up to a heavy dew, so sleeping bags a little damp. Packed up our kit and by 0630 we were on our way to Simitai, 30 watchtowers (6 miles) along the wall. Incredible day, amazing views. Everything we imagined.

Once off the wall, had lunch and headed back to Beijing. Sorted the kit for Richard to take back to the UK with him and went out for a final farewell Peking Duck dinner, where we also met the owner of the company that ran all the tours in Beijing.

Said goodbye to the rest of the group as they were due to leave the hotel at 4am the next morning.

This post will be expanded when we have time, just trying to get back up to date.
