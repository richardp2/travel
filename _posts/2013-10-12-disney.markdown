This Easter we decided it was finally time to visit Paris. I've been promising to take Rosie there for almost as long as we've known each other and I thought it was about time. Also when we left Disney in Hong Kong after my 25th birthday, we decided to do another one for Rosie's 25th. We may be 2 years late, but we have finally made it. Not only did we decide to visit Disney in Paris, but we chose to stay at Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch :-).

Early Tuesday morning, we met up with Mark & Carolyn and jumped on the Shuttle, arriving at the Davy Crockett Ranch by 1pm. We picked up our park tickets and headed straight over to Disney :-).

After picking up a wheelchair and disabled pass for Mark, we were all pretty hungry so we grabbed a bite to eat in one of the cafés on Main Street. This was how we discovered just how expensive food was. It cost us approximately €25 per person for a hot dog, chips and a drink. Ah well! Finally we felt ready to take on the park.

This was then followed by a 10 minute walk from the car park to the main entrance to the two Disney Parks.
