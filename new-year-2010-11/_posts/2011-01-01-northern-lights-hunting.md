Last night we headed out on our Northern Lights Tour/Hunt. We spent three fruitless hours trying to
find gaps in the ever increasing cloud cover, but unfortunately saw not even a glimmer of the
Northern Lights. However, the tour was due to finish at midnight back at the bus depot in Reykjavik,
but due to the enthusiasm of the tour guides, we were still about 10-15 miles outside of Reykjavik
as the New Year was approaching. We took the opportunity to pull over to the side of the road to
watch the fireworks over Reykjavik from afar.

The sight was incredible! As was the noise. Fireworks were being let off from every part of the city
lighting up the whole sky. It was like looking out over Basra! The air reverberated with the low,
loud rumble of persistent explosions over the city as we headed into 2011. It was an absolutely
incredible start to the New Year. Mark managed to get a good video of the scene and hopefully he
will let us link to it at some point :smiley:.
