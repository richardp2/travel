[![The Pool](http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/files/2010/04/the_pool-150x150.jpg)](http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/files/2010/04/the_pool.jpg)To kick start our "Package Holiday" Honeymoon we felt we should follow the traditional British holidaymakers way and lounge around by the pool. So we got out of bed late, caught breakfast just before close and headed to the pool with our suncream, water and books. As the holiday is All Inclusive we took advantage of the bar, pigged out on the buffet lunch, and followed suit with our evening meal as well.

It was a great day, but there's not a whole lot going on at the hotel other than the gym, the pool and the food so I don't think either of us would be able to manage it for an entire holiday. We therefore headed over to the Thomson rep before dinner to book some excursions and to enquire about the best things to do around Marrakech. We have sorted out a tour of the Souks and the Medina (the walled city) for tomorrow, a 4x4 trip to the Atlas Mountains for Thursday and a Marrakech Discovery tour for Sunday (the only day available apparently). This made us feel a lot more comfortable about the whole thing, let's just hope the tours are not too disappointing now. We have also decided that we will visit the gardens by Calesh (horse & cart), and do our own tour of the Ville Nouvelle (new town).
