# Rosie & Jim's Travel Blog

Here resides the source code for our travel blog. At the beginning of 2014, after a number of years using
[WordPress][wp] as my main blogging platform, I decided it was time for a change. So, I have adopted the 
[Jekyll][jk] blogging platform hosted at [GitHub Pages][gp]. 

For more information about the migration process I followed see my [blog series][bs] at my personal [blog][bl].
