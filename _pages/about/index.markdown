Welcome to our Travel Blog. We set this site up as a diary of all our travelling
exploits, starting with our trip to China in the summer of 2009. The blog was set
up to keep everyone informed of where we were and what we were doing while we were
in China for a short 2 month “sabbatical”. All our travel photos can be viewed along
with all our other photos on our [Photo Site][ps].
