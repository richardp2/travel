Whilst in South Africa with the infamous "Troll", we heard about an amazing opportunity to visit Russia, Mongolia and China in the Summer of 2009. Due to both of us having been bitten by the travel bug a few years earlier, this sounded like a great idea. And so, as soon as the information was published, we signed up.

A number of problems with airlines and finances, the Scout Expedition has had to drop the Russian component, but still maintains a three week trip to Mongolia and China.

As time went by, it seemed that Summer 2009 came at the end of a long arduous journey for Richard with (hopefully) the completion of his training (degree and chartership) and so it seemed fitting to extend the trip into more of a gap year. We soon began looking at the options, but our initial plans far exceeded our wallets so the trip was curtailed slightly into the trip you see here.

At the end of March 2008 Rosie was made redundant from her archaeology job at the Newport Ship and decided to take up an offer to became a Health & Safety Officer with [CP Construction (Gwent) Ltd](http://www.cpconstruction.co.uk), but this required her carrying out further training. This may have caused a problem with our plan because taking a "gap year" midway through her studies was not an ideal situation for Rosie. Thankfully she has managed to complete the course and has sat her exams, so our "gap year" is sorted.
