In the summer of 2008, we made the decision to have a proper non-Scouting holiday, just the two of us. And no Scouts. Well we half managed it. We had a holiday, just the 2 of us, but at the International Scout Centre inÂ [Kandersteg](http://www.kisc.ch/), Switzerland.

[![Kandersteg International Scout Centre](http://travel.perry-online.me.uk/files/2008/10/kandersteg.jpg)](http://photos.perry-online.me.uk/albums/travel/2008/switzerland/dscf1952.jpg)Neither of us had been to Switzerland before, and we've heard good things, so we looked into it and found that the cheapest way to stay there (by quite a considerable margin) was at KISC. We therefore snapped up a double room for the first week in October for a tenth of the price of a hotel :-).
