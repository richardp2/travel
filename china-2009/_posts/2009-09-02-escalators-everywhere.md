This morning we decided it was time to visit Hong Kong island itself, so we jumped on the MTR to Admiralty station, picked up some breakfast and coffee and walked along the highlevel walkways to the Central area. This was where Rosie introduced me to Hong Kong's mass of escalators. The first thing we did was to join the hoards on the mid levels escalator. This is a series of escalators that take people who live in Mid Levels down to Central in the morning and back up in the evening. This travels 135m up the Peak along 800m of escalators, travelling down from 0600 to 1000 and up from 1030 to midnight.

Our next port of call was the Hong Kong Botanical Gardens, which also includes a form of zoo. The gardens are set on a steep hill so following our wander through the garden we were back at the bottom of the Peak, further round the North of the Island. We continued along to the Helena May, which is where Rosie stayed when she was here in 2004, and round to the Peak Tram terminal.

It was here that we met Diana. Diana is the daughter of a friend of Rosie's Mum. She whisked us away in her chauffeur driven Lexus to visit the Peak and the site of the old Governers house on the very top of the Peak. We took a walk around the mountain taking in the views from each direction, and then had lunch in a seriously expensive restaurant, paid for by Diana. We finished our time with Diana with a trip down the Peak Tram and tea at the Helena May. We then parted company as Diana had a function to go to.

After finishing our tea, we decided to take a wander through Hong Kong Park on route to the MTR station. It was here that we discovered a huge walk through aviary. This was absolutely amazing, and I am now really glad I bought this camera solely for the pictures I got from the aviary (see [gallery](http://photos.perry-online.me.uk/travel/2009/0805-0911-tour-of-china/0831-0911-hong-kong/)). This led us back to the MTR and Kowloon where we had dinner in an old haunt of Rosie's, the Jade Garden restaurant. Very good food, at a reasonable price. After taking a few night shots of the Hong Kong skyline outside the restaurant, we returned to the hotel.
