Had an early flight from Beijing to Lhasa this morning. Left the hotel just before 0400. After at the aiport very early because the hours taxi ride only lasted 30mins and left the hotel early.

On arrival in Lhasa there was no security checks because it was a domestic flight. We were met by our new guide and driver just outside the airport. We were very tired from the flight, and the altitude (3700m) didn't help one bit, so we spent the afternoon relaxing/sleeping in the hotel room.

Our second day in Lhasa was also fairly uneventful as it was an acclimatisation day. We walked around the town for a bit, picked up a Chinese SIM card so we can keep in contact with our tour guides and the trip organisers if necessary.

This post will be expanded when we have time, just trying to get back up to date.
