Our latest journey started at the relatively late hour of 6am. We headed out to Heathrow for the
first leg toKuala Lumpur. The 12½ hour flight was fairly uneventful, but neither of us managed to
get much sleep so we were both a bit tired on arrival in Malaysia. We had a three hour stop over and
after enquiring we found that we wouldn’t have enough time to actually visit KL. This was a little
disappointing, but the airport had an outdoor courtyard area so we visited that instead.

Our next leg was three more hours up to Hanoi by which point most people were feeling a little worse
for wear. We picked up 3 million Vietnamese Dong (about 90 quid) and met up with our Exodus guide,
Hai. We transferred straight to the hotel for about 2 hours sleep, then after a quick shower and
change we headed out into Hanoi to visit the Old Quarter and get some food. We ate in a quaint
little place called Little Hanoi. The service was friendly and very quick and the food was
excellent! We had a selection of local specialities and drinks and paid a little over £6 for the two
of us. Bargain!

On the way back to the hotel we took a stroll through one of the night markets but most of us were
too tired to really be that interested so just made our way back to the hotel for some proper sleep
following our very long journey to Vietnam.
