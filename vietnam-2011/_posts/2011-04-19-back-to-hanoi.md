We started early again today with a long walk to breakfast, well 5 steps anyway. Oddly, we then had to check
out of our rooms even though we weren’t due back at shore for another 2 hours. The views this morning were
better than yesterday with only a thin morning mist obscuring things. We got back to the boat station at 9am
for the journey back to Hanoi.

The first stop was at a local pineapple stall where we were shown how they cut pineapple in the north. It
certainly looked simple when done by the experts, but when one of our group had a go, I think the stall owner
was a little concerned about him losing a finger. Once we had all sampled the small, sweet pineapple and the
excessively sweet, over sugared, passion fruit, we were back on the bus heading for lunch at a handycraft
place.

Once we arrived back in Hanoi, we began our city tour (or at least very brief highlights tour). We started
off by visiting the Temple of Literature and the University of Hanoi, which are both, located at the same
place. It was quite a beautiful and peaceful place with all sorts of statues and more bonsai, but not a huge
amount of classrooms/places to study that I could see.

The next part of our tour took us to Hỏa Lò Prison, a place built by the French back in the day. The whole
place reminded me of the concentration camp in Niš, Serbia. We were given a load of information by our guide,
Hai, about how terrible the French were to the prisoners when they ran the place, and how brilliant the
Vietnamese were to the prisoners once it was under their control. It seemed to be a very pro-Vietnam
demonstration, although some of the photos of the American prisoners held by the Vietnamese looked almost
staged.

The evening was taken up by a strange but interesting local art form, the Water Puppet Show. It wasn’t really
to my taste, or many of the others in our group, but we still thought it was quite good, and very cleverly
done. We finished the evening with another stroll through the town, back along the street where the night
market had been held a few nights before. It looked completely different! We then had dinner at the hotel
restaurant, a Mandarin Hot Pot restaurant of all things, although it was a little different to the hotpot we
had in Beijing.
