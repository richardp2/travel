It's been 26 years since I was last in Canada, but one thing I do remember is
the time it takes to get here! We left home yesterday at about 09:30, got to the
airport for 12:00, boarded the plane about 15:00, bounced across the Atlantic
for 7&frac34; hours and arrived in Ottawa at 18:30. That messed with George's 
head a little bit given it was bedtime twice before he actually got to bed. He
was shattered by the time we got to Carleton Place, but he completely ignored 
that because of the extreme excitement of seeing Auntie Jacqui! He crashed 
fairly quickly (_along with Rose and I_), but he wanted to get up again at 03:30
:sleepy:.

Thankfully we managed to get him back to sleep for a couple of hours, but we
were still up by 7! Given it was our first day in Canada we didn't really want
to do a lot so Jacqui and Rick arranged for the tribes to visit in the 
afternoon. It was great watching how George interacted with all these people he 
didn't know. As soon as someone new arrived, he pounced on them to tell them all
about the playroom downstairs and the Lego and insisted that they had to come 
down and play! Everyone did what they were told until Jon arrived because he was 
hungry and nothing, not even George, was getting between him and food! Funnily 
enough this didn't seem to bother him, he just grabbed someone else and carried 
on!

It was really nice, if a little hectic, to see my cousins again, and their
families and to meet Rick's kids and their families too. Just a bit of a shame
Rob, Chelsea and their tribe couldn't make it. Hopefully we'll get to catch up
with them before we move on to the Toronto leg of our holiday on Saturday. 

Time for bed now and maybe I'll get this posted before the end of the week
