We were on the road again yesterday morning, but this time it was only 1&frac12; hours down to Niagara Falls :smiley:. It has been my experience that quite often, some of these incredible sights can be a bit of a let down when you see them in real life, but Niagara Falls is definitely not one of those! They are perhaps the most breathtaking natural wonder I have seen, and there is no way to appreciate the insane power of them without seeing them up close and personal!
