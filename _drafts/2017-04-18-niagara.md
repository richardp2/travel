We were on the road again yesterday morning, but this time it was only 1&frac12; hours down to Niagara Falls :smiley:. It has been my experience that quite often, some of these incredible sights can be a bit of a let down when you see them in real life. Niagara Falls is definitely not one of those! They are perhaps the most breathtaking natural wonder I have seen! There is no way to appreciate the insane power of them without seeing them up close and personal! 

We pulled into Niagara Falls late morning and dropped off our car and bags at the hotel. At this point, we had no real plan so we walked down to the falls themselves to take it all in. :open_mouth:! It was just incredible to see the falls in all their glory. Not only are the main Horseshoe Falls epic, but the American Falls are also an amazing sight!

Once we had our [Adventure Passes][ap] we went straight down to the 'Maid of the Mist' dock, only to find that the 'Maid of the Mist' has only operated from the American side since 2013! Thankfully, there is still a boat that does the trip from the Canadian side and that is the '[Hornblower][hb]'. The queue was tiny so we joined and got straight onto the next boat, complete with our awesome red ponchos! The actual trip is only 20 minutes long, but it's actually perfectly adequate to see the incredible power of all 3 sets of falls. You set off past the American Falls, with massive amounts of rock debris at its base. Then you scoot past the Bridal Veil Falls, a much smaller set of falls between the American and Horseshoe Falls. Finally, you arrive in the middle of the horseshoe surrounded by the Horseshoe Falls as &asymp;2,500m&sup3; of water falls down the face of the 50 metre drop every second! The noise is just phenomenal and you get absolutely soaked whilst the boat slowly turns around for the return trip. So the boat trip was only 20 minutes, but what a fantastic experience! Getting so close to the Falls really brings into sharp focus the true power of nature. Amazing!  

After that experience, there was only really one thing we could do, hunt for food :smiley:. Rosie noticed previously that there was a Hard Rock Caf&eacute; somewhere in town so began our mission to find it. Although Niagara Falls is a massive tourist attraction, the town isn't really that big so we headed to the 'strip' and our mission was accomplished. Given we were planning on eating at the fancy steak restaurant, [The Keg Steakhouse][keg], at our [hotel][es] in the evening, it would have made sense to have a light lunch, wouldn't it? Well, we're obviously not that sensible because we ordered full meals, oops!

The afternoon drew us back to the falls, but this time we took a '[Journey Behind the Falls][jb]', and this time we got yellow ponchos :grinning:.
