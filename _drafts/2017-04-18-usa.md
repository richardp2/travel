When planning out this trip, we thought a day in Niagara, with maybe a couple of hours in the morning to see the last few bits, would be plenty, but this morning we woke up and wondered how we would fit in everything we had left! Anyway, we started the day riding the [WEGO][1] out to the [Whirlpool Aero Car][2] for a journey over the Niagara Whirlpool and the border between Canada and the United States of America. The international border between the two countries lies along the centre of the river and crosses the Niagara Whirlpool, so, officially, we crossed into and out of the USA twice on our Aero Car trip over the top of it :smiley:. When we got onto the car(_??_) the operator asked George what his name was (_it was 'Batman' on this occasion_), he was then introduced to the rest of the passengers as Batman making George's day! The operator continued playing this game with George all the way across the gorge and back again, which was great because it meant he didn't realise how windy it actually was out there :smiley:.

The next stop for the day was the [White Water Walk][3]. We hopped off the [WEGO][1] at a little gift shop where we were ushered into a small, old, manually operated lift by a man who then operated the lift for us. After a little spiel about the walk, we alighted at a tunnel that took us to the boardwalk along the side of the Grade 6 rapids of the Niagara River. We've seen some impressive and scary rapids in Switzerland, but they really do pale in comparison to these. I can't believe there are crazy people out there who try to navigate these waters! We walked alongside the rapids to a viewing platform bit about half a mile down river and I have to say, the pictures below really do not show you what it was we were looking at. It looked like you could lose a bus in some of the holes in that river. It was absolutely beautiful and, yet again, highlighted my love/fear of rivers. I feel the need for another paddling trip soon, but on some much less violent water, I think.

Given the day was rapidly disappearing, and we still had a few things to do on route, we headed back to the Falls for a few more pictures and some food before starting our journey back to Toronto.
