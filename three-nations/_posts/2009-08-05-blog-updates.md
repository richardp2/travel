We have had limited internet access recently due to being very busy with the Three Nations expedition, and not staying in hotels for the last couple of nights. Now that the Three Nations expedition has come to a close, we hope to be able to get all the updates on over the next few days. This will include a full breakdown of what we did whilst in Mongolia and Beijing, and probably what we did in Tibet by the time we catch up, however we will endeavour to keep the pictures up to date so you can all see where we have been and what we have been up to.

Hope all is well back home.
