Arrived in Xi'an about 08:00, taken straight to restaurant for breakfast. Turns out Xi'an is in the Sichuan province so almost all dishes contained chillies!

Visited the Terracotta Warriors and the musuem, then retired to the tea house where we tried a wide variety of different teas with various health benefits.

Afternoon took us to the hot springs, which are just like Roman Baths in an elaborate garden.

After a buffet dinner we got back on the train for the trip back to Beijing.

This post will be expanded when we have time, just trying to get back up to date.
